                            Compound activity was analyzed using CBIS data analysis suite (ChemInnovation, CA).

                                % Activity =100% x (mean RLU of test sample - mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean MAX control ligand - mean RLU of vehicle control).

                            For antagonist mode assays, percentage inhibition was calculated using the following formula:

                            Note that for select assays, the ligand response produces an decrease in receptor activity (inverse agonist with a constitutively active target).  
                            For those assays inverse agonist activity was calculated using the following formula:
                            <p>
                                % Inverse Agonist Activity =100% x ((mean RLU of vehicle control - mean RLU of test sample) / (mean RLU of vehicle control - mean RLU of MAX  control)).
